      <p>
        Currently, as student at the University of Connecticut's Coding BootCamp for Full-Stack Web
        Developers, I look forward to completing my program in early November. My goal is to utilize my skills to help
        Businesses, both large and small, develop a web-presence that will increase visibility and profits, meet or
        exceed current standards and keep up with future trends. Organizational and Communications skills
        are of key importance for success, Having worked in a variety of industries, and being a small business owner
        myself, I feel that I can connect with most businesses and have a working knowledge and understanding to dicuss
        their needs.
