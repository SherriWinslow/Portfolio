    <P>
      As a student at the University of Connecticut's Coding BootCamp for Full-Stack Web
      Developers, I look forward to completing my program in early November 2021. My goal is to utilize my skills to
      help
      Businesses, both large and small, develop a web-presence that will increase visibility and profits, meet or
      exceed current standards and keep up with future trends. Organizational and Communications skills
      are of key importance for success, Having worked in a variety of industries, and being a small business owner
      myself, I feel that I can connect with most businesses and have a working knowledge to understand and dicuss
      their needs.
      <br>
      <br>
      When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my husband, two fur-babies (dogs), two daughters, five
      grand-children, and a 2021-model great-grandson. My interests include: computers (of course), photography, music -
      instrumental and singing, martial arts, outdoor activities, travel and marksmanship activities.
      <br>
      <br>
      Having started working with computers in 1980, I enjoy technology, design, and learning new skills. I hope to work
      with you soon to further develop your business.
